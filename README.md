## Claude Code for Machine Learning

Training machine learning models with coding agents is a frustrating experience. 
- They are fantastic at generating endless boilerplate, and even better at wasting tokens debugging it.
- They are great at setting up your experiment, but terrible at writing down the results (or even remembering why they were doing it in the first place).

Coding agents will always want to do what they do best: write code. So building a model becomes an engineering project for every experiment you want to run. And keeping them focused on the task? They are simply not built for the rigor of the scientific method.

That changes now. Claude is no longer a software engineer working on machine learning. _Claude is now a data scientist._

**HarnessML is a complete ML framework, built for agents-first.** Claude Code calls `models(action="add")` or `pipeline(action="run_backtest")` instead of writing training loops — data ingestion, feature engineering, cross-validation, calibration, ensembling, and diagnostics all run through structured tool calls with deterministic results back.

No code. Just data science.

## Harness Studio

A companion web dashboard that runs alongside the agent, giving you full observability into what it's doing and how the model is performing.

### Dashboard
<!-- TODO: Add screenshot — Dashboard overview -->
<img width="1292" height="948" alt="Screenshot 2026-03-08 at 12 06 19 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4184f4d4-c5aa-4de6-8b2e-6c77b299c8df" />

Project vitals, experiment verdict breakdown, primary metric trend with error bars, live MCP activity feed, and a mini pipeline DAG — all updating in real time as the agent works.

### Pipeline DAG
<!-- TODO: Add screenshot — Full DAG view -->
<img width="1555" height="944" alt="Screenshot 2026-03-07 at 11 48 34 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78580e3a-a1de-481d-b6af-886457533df9" />

Interactive pipeline topology. Click any node for full config details. Models added by experiments show with dashed borders and EXP badges. Running nodes pulse during training.

## Activity Monitor
<img width="1429" height="944" alt="Screenshot 2026-03-08 at 12 32 15 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d502e121-3850-4681-872a-603ac4113c06" />

Track experiments as they run with MCP progress messages for all long-running tool calls.

### Experiments
<!-- TODO: Add screenshot — Experiments table with trend chart -->
<img width="1561" height="936" alt="Screenshot 2026-03-07 at 11 45 24 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/223a5f69-70b8-46ef-a807-9243507432e7" />

Every experiment with its hypothesis, verdict, and metric deltas. Trend chart tracks the primary metric across iterations with error bars from cross-validation folds. Side-by-side comparison for any two runs.

### Diagnostics
<!-- TODO: Add screenshot — Diagnostics page -->
<img width="1559" height="944" alt="Screenshot 2026-03-07 at 11 47 32 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e80a321e-96fd-4b22-b374-408a8da11102" />

Per-run deep dive: headline metrics, meta-learner coefficients, model correlation heatmap, calibration curves, residual plots, per-fold breakdown, and the full markdown report.

```bash
uv run harness-studio --project-dir examples/ames-housing
# → http://localhost:8421
```

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/msilverblatt/harness-ml.git && cd harness-ml
uv sync
uv run pytest  # 2300+ tests
```

Add to your Claude Code MCP config (`.mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "harness-ml": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "/path/to/harness-ml", "harness-ml"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then tell Claude what you want to predict.

<br>

## How It Works

The agent never writes training loops. It declares intent through MCP tool calls:

```python
# Ingest data
data(action="ingest", path="data/raw/housing.csv")

# Add models
models(action="add", name="xgb_main", type="xgboost", features=[...])
models(action="add", name="lgb_main", type="lightgbm", features=[...])

# Train and evaluate
pipeline(action="run_backtest")
# → CV splits, training, calibration, ensemble, metrics, logging — all automatic

# Compare to previous
pipeline(action="compare_latest")
# → "RMSE: 24,312 → 22,847 (improved)"

# Iterate with discipline
experiments(action="create", hypothesis="Adding neighborhood features captures location premium")
pipeline(action="run_backtest")
# → Isolated overlay — production config untouched until promoted
```

Every experiment requires a hypothesis. Every run is fingerprinted and logged. Experiments survive session boundaries.
